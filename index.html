                        <p>This subject was a religious one because it grew out of the conflict between The Catholic Church and Martin Luther’s views of Christianity. The Catholic church educated everyone that the only way to ensure salvation was through works while Luther believed that salvation was achieved only through faith. It turned into a political subject as leaders came up and lead the Peasants War throughout Germany.</p>

                    <div class="c">
                        <p>People quickly caught on to this movement as Luther’s writings over religious matters became popular and sparked controversy.

                        <p>
                            Lutheranism originated from Germany around the 1500/1600’s.

                        <p>
                            This subject seems to be a success seeing that Lutheranism is around today due to the spread of Luther’s ideas which appealed to all social classes.

                          Martin Luther’s ideas spread through advancements in technology such as the printing press, which gave people access to Luther’s ideas and the German Translation of the bible.

                            This subject should be studied because the protestant reformation was a revolution involving political and religious issues that were spread through the advancement of technology. It teaches us how a certain branch of Christianity was formed which affects society today. In the modern world, we see can see Lutheran churches and we are able to understand the history behind them. Learning about religion can help us have a better understanding of the people around us and what they believe in and why.

                        <p>
                            My topic was about…. Lutherans, who are people that are part of a branch of Christianity that was created by Martin Luther. Martin Luther’s ideas were very different from the Roman Catholic Church (who gained a lot of money and power). He did not believe that people had the power to ensure another’s salvation, which is part of what the Catholic church was teaching. The Catholic Church taught that salvation was achieved through good works so they used indulgences and other ways to attain money from commoners in exchange for freedom from hell and purgatory. Martin Luther objected to the idea of selling indulgences and other practices so he wrote 95 theses and nailed them to the Wittenberg Catholic Church. In 1518, the pope argued that Martin Luther’s writings were false claims that must be taken back however, he did not recant his statements. This led to his excommunication from the Catholic Church although his impact was rather significant. Martin Luther translated the Latin bible to German which meant that commoners would also be able to read it. He also wrote about his religious views that related to the Catholic Church. Through the printing press, his writings and ideas spread quickly among the people who could also read the Bible for themselves and make their own judgements about Christianity and this was how Lutheranism spread.
